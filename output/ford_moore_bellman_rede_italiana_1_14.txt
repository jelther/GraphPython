************************************
Ford-Moore-Bellman's Algorithm
************************************
Graph Name:  rede_italiana
Start Node:  1
End Node:  14

|Original Algorithm|
Shortest Path from  1  to  14  is:  [1, 3, 8, 11, 14]
Previous Node before  14  is :  11
Shortest Path Length from  1  to  14  is:   535.0
Time Elapsed (in seconds):  7.48219997868e-05
Number of Iterations:  40
Number of Relaxations:  40

|Networkx Algorithm|
Shortest Path from  1  to  14  is :  [1, 3, 8, 11, 14]
Previous Node before  14  is :  11
Shortest Path Length from  1  to  14  is :  535.0
Time Elapsed (in seconds):  0.000114550495249
