************************************
Ford-Moore-Bellman's Algorithm
************************************
Graph Name:  rede_usa
Start Node:  1
End Node:  10

|Original Algorithm|
Shortest Path from  1  to  10  is:  [1, 4, 10]
Previous Node before  10  is :  4
Shortest Path Length from  1  to  10  is:   486.0
Time Elapsed (in seconds):  0.000351597184839
Number of Iterations:  210
Number of Relaxations:  210

|Networkx Algorithm|
Shortest Path from  1  to  10  is :  [1, 4, 10]
Previous Node before  10  is :  4
Shortest Path Length from  1  to  10  is :  486.0
Time Elapsed (in seconds):  0.00042310847667
