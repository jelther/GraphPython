************************************
Ford-Moore-Bellman's Algorithm
************************************
Graph Name:  rede_usa
Start Node:  1
End Node:  40

|Original Algorithm|
Shortest Path from  1  to  40  is:  [1, 2, 9, 13, 40]
Previous Node before  40  is :  13
Shortest Path Length from  1  to  40  is:   1603.0
Time Elapsed (in seconds):  0.00030425406108
Number of Iterations:  210
Number of Relaxations:  210

|Networkx Algorithm|
Shortest Path from  1  to  40  is :  [1, 2, 9, 13, 40]
Previous Node before  40  is :  13
Shortest Path Length from  1  to  40  is :  1603.0
Time Elapsed (in seconds):  0.000410196715645
