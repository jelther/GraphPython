************************************
Ford-Moore-Bellman's Algorithm
************************************
Graph Name:  rede_usa
Start Node:  1
End Node:  60

|Original Algorithm|
Shortest Path from  1  to  60  is:  [1, 4, 10, 20, 37, 42, 52, 60]
Previous Node before  60  is :  52
Shortest Path Length from  1  to  60  is:   2964.0
Time Elapsed (in seconds):  0.000287038379713
Number of Iterations:  210
Number of Relaxations:  210

|Networkx Algorithm|
Shortest Path from  1  to  60  is :  [1, 4, 10, 20, 37, 42, 52, 60]
Previous Node before  60  is :  52
Shortest Path Length from  1  to  60  is :  2964.0
Time Elapsed (in seconds):  0.000444628078379
