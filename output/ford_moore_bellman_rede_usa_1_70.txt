************************************
Ford-Moore-Bellman's Algorithm
************************************
Graph Name:  rede_usa
Start Node:  1
End Node:  70

|Original Algorithm|
Shortest Path from  1  to  70  is:  [1, 3, 23, 33, 47, 55, 57, 70]
Previous Node before  70  is :  57
Shortest Path Length from  1  to  70  is:   3429.0
Time Elapsed (in seconds):  0.000376427494503
Number of Iterations:  210
Number of Relaxations:  210

|Networkx Algorithm|
Shortest Path from  1  to  70  is :  [1, 3, 23, 33, 47, 55, 57, 70]
Previous Node before  70  is :  57
Shortest Path Length from  1  to  70  is :  3429.0
Time Elapsed (in seconds):  0.000421784193488
